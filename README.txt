# MCS360-Trees
A break down of the functions to be understood better 
treespt1.cpp: there are a lot of errors here, but there is a lot of comments
that help out the understanding of the code and the functions

class25.cpp: Working code where we create a tree and populate it, by
a given list (pre made)

class25COM.cpp: Working code with the commentery from treespt1.cpp
